# ud304_Intro_to_HTML_and_CSS

This is my solutions for each lesson and Final Project "Intro to HTML and CSS" Udacity Course.

## Projects

Take a design mockup as a PDF-file and replicate that design in HTML and CSS.

## Syllabus

### Lesson 1 - From Design to Code

Diligently employ a code/test/refine strategy as you precisely and deliberately translate initial design documents into static web pages. You'll also investigate the Document Object Model (DOM) and its implications for web development.

### Lesson 2 - Your Own Framework

Take pride in creating and personalising your own multi-platform, responsive CSS framework for publishing your professional portfolio projects to the web.

### Lesson 3 - Learning and Using Bootstrap

Strategically investigate an existing professional CSS framework as you use it to build a website using responsive design principles while maintaining code readability.
